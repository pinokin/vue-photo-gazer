# Photo Gazer

A simple image gallery using Vue in Vite.

<img alt="Status" title="Status" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status%20good%20enough-7C4F0B?style=for-the-badge" />

## Given requirements

- **Format.** The app needs to be a single-page application (SPA).
- **Basic funtionality.** A grid view (a collection of images) and a details view (showing a single image and its data).

## My own constraints

- **Time.** I will work only a few hours (2-5 h) on this project.
- **Accessibility.** The app needs to be navigable by keyboard and also make sense when using a screen reader.

## Nice to have features
Only if I have the time. Or maybe in the future...

- **Styling.** My own styles without depending Tailwind or similar.
- **Local-first approach.** After the initial load of images, they should be accessible locally.

## Project Setup

```
